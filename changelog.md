- Got rid of base64 encoding/decoding in ElastiKnnVectorFieldMapper. This improves ann-benchmarks performance by about 20%.
---
- Improved exact Jaccard performance by implementing a critical path in Java so that it uses primitive `int []` arrays instead of boxed integers in scala.
---
- Fixed performance regression.
---
- Client and core library interface improvements.
- Added use_cache parameter to KNearestNeighborsQuery which signals that the vectors should only be read once from Lucene and then cached in memory.
---
- Releasing versioned python client library to PyPi.
---
- Releasing versioned elastiknn plugin zip file.
