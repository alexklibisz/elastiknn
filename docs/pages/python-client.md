# Python Client

The Python client provides a pythonic interface for using Elastiknn.
This includes a low level client that roughly mirrors the [Scala client](/scala-client), as well as a higher level "model" that mimics the scikit-learn interface.
The client gets published to PyPI and can be installed using `pip`.
See the versions below.
