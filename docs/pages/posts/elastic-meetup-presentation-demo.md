Thanks to the [Elastic Community](https://www.elastic.co/community/) for hosting a presentation about Elastiknn on December 15, 2020.

The recording and slides are shown below. I'm hoping to procure a higher-resolution recording at some point soon. The demo is available [as a notebook in the Github repo.](https://github.com/alexklibisz/elastiknn/tree/master/examples/tutorial-notebooks)
